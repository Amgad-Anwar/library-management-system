    Postman (for API testing, optional)
    Docker (for optional dockerization)
    Git (for version control)

Installation
Step 1: Clone the repository

    git clone https://github.com/amgad-anwar/library-management-system.git
    cd library-management-system

Step 2: Install dependencies

    npm install

Make sure to replace the database credentials and JWT_SECRET with your own values in .env file .
Step 3: Set up the MySQL database

    Log in to your MySQL instance and create a new database:


    CREATE DATABASE bosta_library_management_system;

    Import the database schema 

    mysql -u root -p bosta_library_management_system < schema.sql

Step 4: Running the application

    npm start
    The API will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.

Step 5: Testing the API

    You can use Postman  to test the API. Here's a brief overview of the available API endpoints:
